------------------------------------------

> This repository is a collection of various algorithms implemented in different programming language. These examples serve as a great starting point for those who want to learn more about coding and its applications.

## Contents

1. `C` [Simulating Space Invaders](./1_SpaceInvaders/README.md): This program simulates the classic game of Space Invaders. It demonstrates how to handle user input, game physics, collision detection, and rendering in C.
2. `C` [Drawing a Flower with Recursive Circles](./2_CircleFlowers/README.md): This program draws a flower with recursive circles. The number of circles is provided via the command line. It's a great example of recursion and graphics programming in C.
3. `C` [Floodfill](./3_Floodfill/README.md): This program identifies if its surroundings are identical and if so, it replaces them in the same way to the starting position by command line.
4. `C` [Christmas Tree](./4_ChristmasTree/README.md): This program draws a Christmas tree on the console. It's a fun example of how to use loops and string manipulation in C.
5. `C` [Turtle Moves](./5_TurtlesMoves/README.md): This program simulates the movements of a turtle on a 2D grid. It's a great example of how to handle complex data structures and algorithms in C.
6. `C` [Mouse Labyrinth](./6_MouseLabyrinth/README.md): This program draws a maze and solves it via command line.
7. `C++` [Monopoly Games of Thrones](./7_MonopolyGOT/README.md): This is a text-based version of the classic Monopoly game with a twist of the Game of Thrones theme. The game supports up to eight players and follows the same rules as the original Monopoly.
